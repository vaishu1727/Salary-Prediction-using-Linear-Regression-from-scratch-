# Salary-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression-from-scratch-
Implemented Linear Regression from scratch using Python and applied it to a Salary dataset to predict salaries based on years of experience. The model was built without libraries like scikit-learn, using only NumPy for calculations. It includes training, prediction, evaluation, and visualization.
